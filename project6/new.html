        <p>Powered by a 998 cc in-line four-cylinder engine, the motor comes with a centrifugal supercharger. The motor manages to belt out 308 bhp in stock form, which can be further increased to 321 bhp with the Ram Air intake. Peak torque output stands at 165 Nm available at 12,500 rpm.</p>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>The Kawasaki Ninja H2R is the track-focused, non-street-legal version of the Ninja H2.</li>
            <li>Unveiled alongside the H2, the H2R was designed explicitly for closed-course use, featuring more aggressive tuning and enhanced aerodynamics.</li>
            <li>The H2R's engine output was even more impressive, and it did not have the electronic speed limiters imposed on street-legal bikes.</li>
            <li>The H2R was known for its incredibly high top speed and track performance, making it a showcase of Kawasaki's engineering prowess.</li>

<h2>Advanced electronics</h2>
<div class="container1">

        <h2>Featuring</h2>
        <p>Key enhancements bring Kawasaki Racing Team (KRT) WorldSBK championship-proven electronics management technology to the Ninja H2®R motorcycle.</p>
        <p>compact IMU enables inertia along 6 Degrees of Freedom to be monitored (acceleration along longitudinal, transverse and vertical axes, plus roll rate and pitch are measured).</p>
        <p>Whereas many competitive traction control systems react to wheel-slip, this IMU-enhanced feedback version of Kawasaki TRaction Control (KTRC) predicts conditions and acts before slippage exceeds the range for optimal traction.</p>
        <p>Modes allow riders to choose the degree in which KTRC intervenes during riding. KTRC can also be switched off completely. The Öhlins electronic steering damper adjusts damping based on a number of inputs. At lower speeds, damping is lessened. As speed increases, steering damping increases for optimal performance. Three-mode KLCM provides unmatchable acceleration from a stop by electronically controlling engine output to minimize rear wheel-slip and front-end lift. Kawasaki Launch Control Mode allows the rider to launch from a stop with the throttle held wide open.</p>
