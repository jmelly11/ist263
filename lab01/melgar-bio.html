<body>Im Josue Melgar and I am currently majoring in Information Management Technology with a concentration in cyber security, with the hopes of becoming a cyber security technician. I have an associate in liberal arts and currently serving in the Vermont Army National Guard as a second lieutenant. In part to the army I am a hard worker, critical thinker, and a good leader. I also am very passionate about cars, and enjoy a couple cartoons like regular show and cyberpunk 2077: Edge runners. I have a really big family second youngest sibling out of 8 total with the youngest being my little brother who is 17.
